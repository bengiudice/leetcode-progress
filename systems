latency & throughput
 2 most important perforance measures
 not neceserily collelated
 latency 
  (time it takes for data to traverse system)
  1MB read seq RAM       250 us    0.25 ms
  1MB read ssd         1 000 us    1    ms
  1MB 1Gbps network   10 000 us   10    ms
  1MB HDD             20 000 us   20    ms
  1pkt ICRT          150 000 us  150    ms
 throughput
  (work machine can perform or support in given time)
  operations system can handle per time unit
  requests per second RPS
  queries  per second QPS
  bottleneck, fit-through
  pay more -> increase throughput
  Gbps Mbps Kbps bps

availability
 resistance to failures
 fault-tolerance
 percentage of a systems uptime in a given year
 nines
  55.5555555 nine  fives 162.33 days 
  90         one   nine
  95         one and a half nines
  99         two   nines
  99.9       three nines
  99.99      four  nines
  99.999     five  nines
  99.9999999 nine  nines
  five nines is the gold standard (5.26 min)
 service level agreement SLA 
  SLA is made up of objectives SLOs
 HA high availability
 tradeoffs (may increase latency and lower throughput)
 what subsystems require HA
 eliminate single points of failure via redundancy
  may require (multiple) load balancers
  pasive redundancy
   adding extra servers
   aeroplane engines
  active redundancy
   swarm which reacts to single failures
   warm servers?
   reconfigure
   leader election?
 rigourous process in place to handle and react to failures
